description:
The Duplex Apartment Project Model was produced in Weimar Germany 
for a design competition. Permission was given by the author in 2009 to 
ERDC and the buildingSMART alliance to use for purposes of research and 
development. This model was updated in 2011 by Kristine Fallon and Associates 
through a contract with the Engineer Research and Development Center. 
The purpose of this update was to utilize the Revit 2011 to produce the 
most complete model possible in support of the FM Handover MVD (or COBie) exchange.
